Food insecurity has also grown from students not receiving a meal at schools are closed or operating virtually due to Covid-19.In April 41% of mothers with children under the age of 13 reported recent food insecurity, which is the highest level since 2001. In addition, the non-profit organization, Feeding America, projects 18 million children could be food insecure in 2020. While many school districts are operating in a grab-n-go fashion, many students are unable to make it to these sites. For example, many school districts operate summer feeding programs. However, in 2018 only 14.1% of kids who received a free or reduced-price meals during the school year got a meal over the summer. Barriers for students getting grab-n-go meals include transportation barriers, families not knowing meals are available, and sites not being open when families are able to pick up meals.\nThis project will look at where grab-n-go sites should be placed within the Lewisville ISD school district. Selecting the right grab-n-go sites is crucial in helping students overcome the barriers preventing them from getting the food they need. "
