Food insecurity has also grown from students not receiving a meal at schools are closed or operating virtually due to Covid-19.In April 41% of mothers with children under the age of 13 reported recent food insecurity, which is the highest level since 2001. In addition, the non-profit organization, Feeding America, projects 18 million children could be food insecure in 2020. While many school districts are operating in a grab-n-go fashion, many students are unable to make it to these sites. For example, many school districts operate summer feeding programs. However, in 2018 only 14.1% of kids who received a free or reduced-price meals during the school year got a meal over the summer. Barriers for students getting grab-n-go meals include transportation barriers, families not knowing meals are available, and sites not being open when families are able to pick up meals.\nThis project will look at where grab-n-go sites should be placed within the Lewisville ISD school district. Selecting the right grab-n-go sites is crucial in helping students overcome the barriers preventing them from getting the food they need. "

Since schools in the Lewisville High School feeder pattern are close together, it would make sense to select schools outside this feeder pattern, as well, even if these schools do not have the most free and reduced students. Machine learning could have been used to cluster the schools, but this would have not been beneficial since similar schools would more than likely be geographically close to each other, which is something we are trying to avoid in selecting the sites."

For example, parents way be working and students may have to walk to the sites. The number of sites selected will play a big role in determing the sites. If few sites are selected, it would be advantageous to select sites that are geographically separated compared to just selecting the sites with the highest need. Also, it is important to evaluate other resources that are available outside of the school district's feeding program to prevent two feeding programs from targeting the same students."
